It's so small that in practice you'll never be able to hit any query limits so you can run as many tests as you want.\n\nI'll show you how to run a simple query against BigQuery and export the results to Pandas. We'll start with a helper library that lets us do this in one line and then move on to exploring how that function works.\n\nIf you're looking to get started quickly you can just use bq_helper to execute a SQL query.
